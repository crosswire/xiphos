FAILED: jmercado-virt-858-fleximaqe -- source of public image
Two public images created with name "ghellings - *"

MinGW installation on Fedora:
1) Install Fedora 17 or later
2) Fetch your favorite copy of the Xiphos source code that supports MinGW builds
3) Create a file /etc/yum.repos.d/greg_hellings.repo with the following contents:
[greg_hellings]
name=Greg Hellings' OBS repository
baseurl=http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/greg_hellings:/fedora-mingw/Fedora_17/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
3) yum install mingw32-{gtkhtml3,webkitgtk3,libgsf,gconf2,sword,libtiff,gdb} intltool wine glib2-devel
4) Download the latest nsis-Unicode version: http://code.google.com/p/unsis/downloads/list
5) Run the installer, installing to the default location (if your wine is configured differently than
the default Fedora installation, you will need to alter the final line of makeDistroGTK3.sh to point
to your proper install location).
