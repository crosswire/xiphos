    * remove files unnedded for generating the installer

    * Name for the installer binary: "Xiphos-3.0-win32.exe"

    * Try to simplify i18n declaration
        - inspiration at other OSS projects using NSIS

    * remove 'sword://' handler only, when it was set by GS

    * Shortcuts - ask user whether install them for all users or only
      for current users

    * Write tutor how to generate NSIS installer
