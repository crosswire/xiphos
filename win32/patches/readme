This is a place to store patches necessary for Windows builds of Xiphos
dependencies rather than storing them nowhere (in the case of ICU) or in a
separate repository (for SWORD).

SWORD is patched against current trunk. The patch adds two build scripts, one
for Windows and one for cross-compiling. In addition the patch fixes the
UTF16/NTFS issues on Windows by using glib i/o functions. The patches will be
separated into individual patches later.

ICU is a patch against ICU 4.0.1. It fixes a couple of missing includes and also
patches the mingw configuration script. It should be necessary for both building
on Windows and for cross-compiling.
