
Currently we're using gnome-vfs version 14 (no openssl)[http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gnome-vfs/2.14/gnome-vfs-2.14.2-no-openssl.zip]  because that's the latest version that works on w2k

Cannot change the verion of gconfd used or the associated dll's because images stop working in the menus (this is ridiculous). We need to get rid of the gconf dependency.

The sword that I modified is at http://code.google.com/p/xiphos-sword/.

I am using tdragon's mingw distro along with msys 1.0.11. He has binaries for gcc/g++ 4.3.3. I got the SJLJ Unwinding versions. Site is http://www.tdragon.net/recentgcc.

Currently I'm building icu, curl, imagemagick, clucene, and sword, in addition to xiphos.
