
Currently we're using gnome-vfs version 14 (no
openssl)[http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gnome-vfs/2.14/gnome-vfs-2.14.2-no-openssl.zip]
because that's the latest version that works on w2k

Cannot change the verion of gconfd used or the associated dll's because images
stop working in the menus (this is ridiculous). We need to get rid of the gconf
dependency.

The sword that I modified is at http://code.google.com/p/xiphos-sword/.

I am using tdragon's mingw distro along with msys 1.0.11. He has binaries for
gcc/g++ 4.3.3. I got the SJLJ Unwinding versions. Site is
http://www.tdragon.net/recentgcc.

Currently I'm building icu, curl, imagemagick, clucene, and sword, in addition
to xiphos.
