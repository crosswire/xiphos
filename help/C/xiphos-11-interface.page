    <title>Menubar</title>
    <p>At the top of the <app>Xiphos</app> main window is the menubar. Almost
    all of the functions are available by activating the appropriate menu item.
    The functions have been grouped according to their type. For example, the
    file operations have been grouped into the <gui>File</gui> menu.</p>

    <title>Toolbars</title>
    <p>The function of the Toolbar is to provide control over the Bible and
    Commentary Panes. Activation of the Toolbar option is done by moving the
    mouse cursor over the desired toolbar button and selecting it. A tooltip
    will appear if the mouse cursor is held stationary over a toolbar button,
    describing the function of the button.</p>
    <media type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/interface_toolbar.png" />

    <p>On the left hand side of <app>Xiphos</app> there is the Sidebar. Here
    the user can switch between the different Sword modules, view bookmarks, do
    simple searches and view verse lists. In the Modules listing, a module may
    be chosen for viewing in the current tab of the main window by clicking it.
    Using the context (right-click) menu, other options are to open a new tab
    using the module, open a separate (i.e. detached) window, or to view the
    "About" information for the module.</p>

    <p>To switch between all Sidebar functions, buttons have been placed at the
    top of the Sidebar.</p>

    <section id="xiphos-bible-parallel">
      <title>Using the Parallel View Mode</title>

      <p>A nice function in <app>Xiphos</app> is the ability to view your
      specified bible text in several parallel translations of your choice. The
      Parallel View mode can be accessed by selecting <gui>Parallel View</gui> 
      just below the <gui>Bible Text Pane</gui>, next to the <gui>Standard View
      </gui> tab.</p>

      <p>You must choose which modules to display in parallel with the <gui>
      Preferences</gui> dialog found under the <gui>Edit</gui> menu. In the
      dialog, choose Modules, then Parallel. You can add or subtract from the
      list of modules that will be shown in the parallel view. The toolbar gives
      you a selector tool to erase the list, delete a module from the list, and
      add modules to the list.</p>

      <p>The <gui>Parallel View</gui> shows just one verse at a time. You can
      change the verse by selecting another verse, chapter, or book at the
      toolbar. Also note that modules that are Old Testament or New Testament
      only (e.g. Westminster Leningrad Codex, Byzantine Majority Text) will not
      be able to display books that they don't have.</p>
      <media style="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/interface_parallel.png" />

      <p>Additionally, a separate Parallel View window can be selected from the
      right click menu with <gui>Detach/Attach</gui>. Your Bible pane will
      return to its normal single text view, and the new Parallel View window
      will show the complete chapter, showing the same translations.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="xiphos-bible-open-separate">
      <title>Opening A Separate Bible Translation</title>
      <p>In order to view a Bible translation separate from the <app>Xiphos
      </app> main window interface, under the <gui>Modules</gui> option in the
      <gui>Sidebar</gui>, choose <guiseq><gui>Biblical Texts</gui><gui>language
      choice</gui></guiseq>.  Then right-click on a translation and choose <gui>
      Open in dialog</gui>. The module will open in a separate, detached window
      of its own.</p>

      <p>Detached Bible and commentary windows have a synchronization button in
      the upper-left position beside the navigation bar. When this button is
      depressed, the main window Bible and commentary will synchronize with
      detached Bible and commentary windows. The synchronization goes both ways:
      Any detached window will synchronize navigation with all other detached
      Bibles and commentaries plus the main window, and the main window will
      drive all detached Bibles and commentaries whose synchronization button
      is depressed.</p>

    <section id="xiphos-view-options">
      <title>View Options</title>
      <p>There are several additional modes that can be selected from the
      menubar's <gui>View</gui> pulldown.</p>
      <media style="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/interface_menubar-view.png" />

      <p>The first 4 checkboxes control whether each named subwindow is
      displayed. The viewable state of the subwindows is remembered on a per-tab
      basis. This makes it possible, for example, to have a tab dedicated to a
      maps module alone (in a dictionary module, having alphabetically-listed
      places), by turning off the display of Bible, Previewer, and Commentary
      for that tab.</p>

      <p>The remaining checkboxes control these other display features:</p>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>Link Tabs - When more than one tab is open, each one's verse is
	  navigated separately in the disabled case. If tab linking is enabled,
	  then all tabs navigate together, keeping all translations on the same
	  verse.</p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>Read Aloud - If you enable this, then <app>Xiphos</app> will funnel
	  all selected verses through the <app>festival</app> text-to-speech
	  system. <app>Festival</app> is a widely-available TTS, often installed
	  by default in Linux distributions.</p>

	  <p>Also, mouse-selected text may be read aloud from Bibles,
	  commentaries, and general books, using the right-click menu,
	  regardless of whether Read Aloud is selected.	</p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>Show Verse Numbers - Normally enabled, this toggle can be disabled
	  to prevent display of verse numbers within the text.</p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>Highlight Current Verse - Initially disabled, this toggle replaces
	  mere alternate colorization of the current verse with a substitute
	  high-contrast highlight. The colors used may be selected from the
	  Preferences dialog.</p>
	</item>
      </list>
    </section>

    <section id="xiphos-default-css">
      <title>Display Control with CSS</title>
      <p>Users familiar with CSS (cascading style sheets) may wish to create the
      file "default-style.css" in the .xiphos directory to contain whatever CSS
      controls are desired. Beware, it is very easy to shoot oneself in the foot
      with CSS, and this will affect all modules' display. The facility exists
      to provide the capability that advanced users may wish.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="xiphos-user-annotation">
      <title>User Annotation</title>
      <p>Many users wish to make personal annotations on individual verses,
      without the need to put a full "personal commentary" module to use.
      <app>Xiphos</app> provides this in the right-click context menu in the
      Bible pane. This brings up a dialog showing the current verse reference
      and offering a text box into which to enter a brief personal note. Once
      the user closes the dialog with "Annotate Verse," the verse will be
      displayed in reverse-highlight (default, blue on yellow) and a marker
      <gui>*u</gui> will be inserted at the verse's beginning.  This is
      metaphorically similar for users who mark verses in paper Bibles with a
      yellow highlighter and write personal notes in the margins.</p>

      <p>Selecting an already-annotated verse will (in the usual case) bring up
      the existing content for re-editing. An already-annotated verse can be
      unmarked; the verse will cease to show in reverse-highlight.</p>

      <p>If the user deletes the module name from the reference at the top of
      the dialog, then the annotation will apply to any Bible module at the
      selected verse. However, in this case, re-selecting the annotated verse
      will not initialize with the existing content, because the dialog is
      created based on the specific module reference.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="xiphos-geography-support">
      <title>Geography Support</title>
      <p>A connection to browsing BibleMap.org is available by mouse-selecting
      a place name in any text.  Use the right-click context menu to select
      <guiseq><gui>Lookup Selection</gui><gui>Browse in BibleMap.org</gui>
      </guiseq>. A web browser will be brought up to show the selected name's
      geography via BibleMap, which provides Biblical detail overlaid on a
      Google Maps interface.</p>

      <title>Specific Word Meanings</title>
      <p>In order to check the meaning of a specific word, double-click on the

    <!-- ============= Previewer	================ -->

    <title>Previewer</title>
    <media style="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/interface_viewer.png" />

    <p>The Previewer is where the user sees Strong's numbers, morphological
    tags, footnotes, and cross-references that the <gui>Bible Text Pane</gui>
    provides.</p>

    <p>Footnote content is displayed in the Previewer when you hover over the
    indicator <gui>*n</gui> in the Bible text; it remains visible until your
    mouse moves over another indicator, Strong's number, etc. Sometimes you may
    want the text to remain anchored until you can move the mouse to the
    previewer to click on a link or to read large footnotes. To anchor the text
    so that you can scroll it in the Previewer, middle-click the indicator (or
    hold down the <gui>Shift key</gui>) and move to the Previewer.</p>

    <p>Cross-reference indicators <gui>*x</gui> work much the same way.
    Clicking the indicator will send the set of references to the <gui>Verse
    List</gui> in the <gui>Sidebar</gui>, where you can click them individually
    for reading in the Previewer. Alternately, a Preferences selector is
    available, so that cross-reference lists are sent to the verse list
    instead.</p>

    <p>Any verses shown in reverse-highlight have personal annotation associated
    with them, and such verses will include <gui>*u</gui> at the beginning of
    the verse. Hovering on this marker will show the annotation in the
    previewer, just as for publisher's footnotes.</p>

    <p>If a devotional has been set via the Preferences dialog, then the day's
    devotional reference will also appear in the previewer, either on program
    startup or when the user requests it via the <gui>View</gui> menu.</p>

    <title>The Commentary Pane</title>
    <media style="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/interface_commentarypane.png" />

    <p>The <gui>Commentary pane</gui> is where the commentary modules are
    displayed. This provides easy reading, reference, and access to different
    commentaries currently installed. The passage viewed by the <gui>Commentary
    pane</gui> is directly controlled by the current passage viewed in the
    <gui>Bible Text pane</gui>, so in order to change to a different passage
    commentary, select the desired passage on the <gui>Toolbar</gui>.</p>

    <p>If there are images that are part of a commentary, general book, or
    dictionary/lexicon, they may be clicked to invoke a viewer on that single
    image, in order to get a better view.  This is particularly useful if image
    resizing has been enabled with the result that images are made very small
    in the subwindow.</p>
    <note>
      <p>By changing to passage settings on the <gui>Toolbar</gui>, the contents
      in the <gui>Bible Text pane</gui> and the <gui>Commentary Pane</gui> will
