		In <guimenuitem>Advanced Search</guimenuitem>, much more complex queries can be constructed, involving custom search ranges,
		custom lists of modules over which to search, regular expression matching (see next section), and attribute-based searches
		such as are found in footnotes or Strong's Hebrew and Greek dictionary references.
	   </para>

	   <para>
		The default search is multi-word, a somewhat slow and blunt search through module text.  Also available is an optimized
		search based on the Lucene indexing and search library. In order to use the optimized search, the index must be constructed
		beforehand: Please see the preceding section on the Module Manager regarding the Maintenance functions, including indexing. A
		web search will provide several references to the syntax needed to put to use the power of optimized Lucene search. A few
		examples follow:
	   </para>
	   
	   <para>
		Simple Searches: just type in the words you want to search for. To return only verses that include all of the words,
		prefix the word with "+". So, in the KJV, you could find Psalm 23 by searching for "+Lord +shepherd +want". To search for
		an entire phrase, surround the entire phrase with quotes, like "maketh me to lie down" (note that quotes are unnecessary
		in all of the other examples).
	   </para>
	   
	   <para>
		Single Letter Wildcard: to search for "veil" or "vail", use this syntax "v?il". The "?" represents a single character
		that could be anything. A more complex example returns both spellings for Isaiah used in the KJV. "?saia?" will return
		results for "Isaiah" and "Esaias".
	   </para>

	   <para>
		Multiple Letter Wildcard: to search for "prophet" or "prophesy" or "prophecy" or "prophesied", use this syntax "prophe*".
	   </para>

	  <para>
		AND syntax: in the advanced search to return results for all of the search terms, you must put "AND" in between the terms.
		To continue our example, if we wish to search for any occurrence of Isaiah or Esaias that also mention either prophet, or
		prophecy, or prophesy, we can do a search like this: "?saia? AND prophe*". 
	  </para>

	   <para>
		By default, two standard search ranges are defined, for Old and New Testament; you may wish to define others for
		e.g. "Gospels" or "Paul's Epistles". One custom module list containing only the first Bible found will be present.
		If desired, new searches can be performed across only the current results of the previous search.  Any modules may be
		searched, including general books and even dictionaries, in any combination.
	   </para>

	   <para>
		Note the tooltip in the screenshot above, for Attributes search.  This qualifier is used to perform searches on attributes
		that are carried with verses, instead of verse content proper, such as footnote content or Strong's Hebrew and Greek
		references.  If this button is selected, specific attribute qualifiers must be made in the Attribute Search tab, at the
		right end of the tab set.  Strong's references are identified with a leading "H" or "G" and the numeric Strong's identifier.
		Thus, a search of KJV for Strong's Greek #140, using "G140", will return the single result of Matthew 12:18.
	   </para>
		
	   <para>
		If you have indexed your modules, there is a much faster way to search for Strong's references. Enter your search preceded by 
		"lemma:", so to search for Strong's Greek #140, enter "lemma:G140". You must have selected <guibutton>Optimized ("Lucene")</guibutton>
		for this to work.
	  </para>

	   <para>
		The "Find" button also stops an in-progress search, as its tooltip indicates.
	   </para>

	   <para>
		Results will show in the <guibutton>Results</guibutton> tab. If you wish to show Strongs, Morphology, or Footnote tags,
		make those selections on the <guibutton>Attributes Search</guibutton> tab. Clicking once on the result will show the result
		in the <guibutton>Advanced Search</guibutton> previewer. Hovering over Strongs, Morphology, Footnote, or Cross-reference
		tags will show the results in the main previewer. Double-clicking a result will cause the current tab to navigate to that
		result. This applies to search results in general books and commentaries as well, but note that the respective tab must
		be visible.
	   </para>

	   <warning>
	   	<para>
		 Changes to some of the settings (e.g. scope of search, searched modules, etc.) in Advanced Search will 	affect the simple search via the side pane but not vice versa.

		<title>Search Syntax using Regular Expression</title>

		<para>
			Regular expression searches provide a way to do simple or complex searches for strings that match a pattern or set of patterns (branches) separated by vertical bars &quot;|&quot;. While a pattern can be built to look for a word or phrase, a simple pattern that consists of a word does not look for only that word but for any place the string of letters that make that word are found. A search for &quot;right&quot; will return verses that contain the word &quot;right&quot;, but also &quot;<emphasis>right</emphasis>eous&quot;, &quot;<emphasis>right</emphasis>eousness&quot;, &quot;un<emphasis>right</emphasis>eous&quot;, &quot;up<emphasis>right</emphasis>&quot; and even &quot;b<emphasis>right</emphasis>&quot;. A search for &quot;hall not&quot; is not a search for &quot;hall&quot; AND &quot;not&quot; but for the string &quot;hall not&quot; with a space between the second &quot;l&quot; and the &quot;n&quot;. The search for &quot;hall not&quot; will find occurrences of &quot;s<emphasis>hall not</emphasis>&quot;.
		</para>
		<para>
			The power of Regular Expressions is in the patterns (or templates) used to define a search. A pattern consists of
ordinary characters and some special characters that are used and interpreted by a set of rules. Special characters include
.\[^*$?+. Ordinary (or simple) characters are any characters that are not special. The backslash, &quot;\&quot;, is used to convert special characters to ordinary and ordinary characters to special.
		 </para>
		<para>
			Example: the pattern &quot;<emphasis>i. love\.</emphasis>&quot; will find sentences that end with &quot;h<emphasis>i</emphasis>s <emphasis>love</emphasis>&quot; or &quot;<emphasis>i</emphasis>n <emphasis>love</emphasis>&quot; or &quot;<emphasis>i</emphasis>s <emphasis>love</emphasis>&quot; followed by
a period. The first period in &quot;i. love\.&quot; is a special character that means allow any character in this position. The
backslash in &quot;i. love\.&quot; means that the period following it is not to be considered a special character, but is
an ordinary period.
