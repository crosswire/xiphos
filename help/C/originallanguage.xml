	 	<title>Setting Up</title>
		<para>While still in the module manager, create indexes for all of the modules you just installed. 
		Then close the module manager and open <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Edit</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>
		Preferences</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and go to <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Modules</guisubmenu>
		<guimenuitem>Misc</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. Set your Hebrew and Greek lexicons according to what you installed.
		Close preferences and open the KJV module. Turn on the module options <menuchoice>
		<guisubmenu>Right Click</guisubmenu><guisubmenu>Module Options</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Show Strongs
		</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Right Click</guisubmenu><guisubmenu>Module Options
		</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Show Morphology</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You should see the Bible text
		change to show Strongs numbers underneath the appropriate English words. Hover over the numbers 
		(or letters for morphology) with the mouse and you will see the definition displayed in the previewer pane. 
		Click on the link and the definition will show in the dictionary pane. If you are using StrongsRealGreek or
		StrongsRealHebrew, you can click on any other number referenced in the definition and you will be taken to that entry.

		<para>Choose <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Edit</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Advanced Search</guimenuitem></menuchoice>or press

		Click on the <interface>Attribute Search</interface> tab, and make check the box that says <guibutton>
		Strongs Numbers</guibutton>. Now click in the entry field at the top and search for the number you are looking for
		preceded by "lemma:" and "G" for Greek or "H" for Hebrew. So to look for the Hebrew word tsad-deek (6662), enter 
		"lemma:H6662". Once the search is done, the results pane will be shown. Notice that when you click on a result, 
		it will show the result in the preview pane, and the strong's numbers will show as well, following immediately 
		after the words they match. Also note that hovering over these numbers will show the definition in the main preview pane.
