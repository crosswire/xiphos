  		<title>Introduction To The Module Manager</title>
		<para>
		The "module" is the unit of content in <application>Xiphos</application>, and Sword generally; a Sword module is a
		resource available for viewing in Sword applications.  There are several varieties: Most importantly, Bible texts, as well
		as dictionaries and lexicons, commentaries, and general books, any of which may include image content (e.g. atlases).
		They are installed either from a local directory structure (typically on removable media, such as a CDROM distribution)
		or remotely via ftp from a repository such as Crosswire, which is the home of Sword, and from which all officially
		Sword-sanctioned modules are available.  Also, many other modules are available from non-Crosswire repositories.
		</para>
		<para>
		If you have other Sword applications installed, they will all share the same set of Sword modules that you install through
		the Module Manager.

				<title>Linux</title>
				<para>
    				Unless you run as root (via su or sudo) you will only be able to install in your personal area, under ~/.sword.
				If you run as root, or change permissions on the shared directory, you will also be able to install modules for
				all users, typically in /usr/share/sword. There have been some requests for Xiphos to provide a means by which
				an ordinary (non-root) user could start the program, gain temporary write access to the system area while installing
				modules, and then revoke that access after installation is complete.  Attempting to devise a scheme to do this has
				proven quite difficult, given the different superuser management schemes employed by various Linux distributions. 
				Therefore, at this time there are no ongoing plans to try to solve this problem, and users are advised to enable 
				write access to the system area outside Xiphos.

		The module manager generates both a per-type module list as well as a parallel availability list.  The latter is
		intended to make it easier to find new items without having to work one's way through the per-type list, one subtree at a
		time.  Modules which are either not yet installed or updated beyond what is currently installed will appear in both lists.
		</para>
		<para>
		Modules that are already installed will show a checkmark beside them.  If a fast search ("lucene") index is available, a magnifying glass will be
		displayed, otherwise an "X" will be shown; creation of the index is available on the Maintenance pane.  Locked modules, which require that you
		purchase an unlock key from the module's copyright holder, will show a lock symbol.  If there are modules installed for which a more recent
		version is available, a refresh icon will appear between the differing old and new version stamps.  There may be an approximate size displayed,
		if the repository management provides this information, otherwise a question mark ("-?-") will be shown.
		</para>
		<para>
		Select new modules to be installed by clicking the checkboxes and then the Install button at the bottom.  Any number of
		modules may be requested for installation at one time.
		</para>
		<para>
		If you acquire a locked module and have obtained the cipher key for it, the module is then unlocked in the main window: Open
		the module, which will probably appear blank, then using the right-click context menu, choose "Unlock This Module."

		<para>
		Several maintenance functions are available: Removal, archival, index, and index deletion.
		</para>
		<para>
		Removal disposes of a module entirely.  There is no recovery of the module unless you have previously archived a copy of it.
		</para>
		<para>
		Archival is available for any module, although it is provided with personal commentaries specifically in mind.  A *.zip of
		the module is left in the directory ~/.sword/zip.  Archival prior to removal of personal commentaries is recommended, in
		order to be available for future re-install if the subject matter of the personal commentary becomes important again.
		</para>
		<para>
		Indexing is provided so that the underlying Sword search support can create the index needed for the "lucene" multi-word
		fast-search functions.  If the index is not created, multi-word search will still be available, but it will be much slower.
		With the index in place, searches through an entire Bible can take just a few seconds.

		<para>
		Some resource modules in Sword Project format are available from sources other than Crosswire and not from a module manager-ready repository.
		Necessarily, installing such a module is a manual task.
		</para>
		<para>
		Modules are normally packaged as *.zip files; they contain a configuration file plus a number of data files.  Installation
		of such a module is done by cd'ing to your personal Sword (not <application>Xiphos</application>) configuration
		directory, ~/.sword, and unzipping the file there.  The configuration file will be left in "mods.d", and the module's data
		files will go into a subdirectory of "modules".  Alternatively, if you have write access to the system Sword directory,
		typically /usr/share/sword, you may cd there instead before unzipping.
		</para>
		<para>
		Restart <application>Xiphos</application> after installing such a module, so that a fresh instance of the program can
		notice the new module in place.
