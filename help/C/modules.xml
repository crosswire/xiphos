  		<title>Introduction To The Module Manager</title>
		<para>
		The "module" is the unit of content in GnomeSword, and Sword generally; a Sword module is a resource available for viewing
		in Sword applications.  There are several varieties: Most importantly, Bible texts, as well as dictionaries and lexicons,
		commentaries, and general books, including some which have graphical content (e.g. atlases).  They are installed either
		from a local directory structure (such as a CDROM distribution) or remotely via ftp from a server such as Crosswire, which
		is the home of Sword, and from which all officially Sword-sanctioned modules are available.
		</para>
		<para>
		If you have other Sword applications installed, they will all share the same set of Sword modules that you install through
		the Module Manager.

			<para>
			Take note of the "Install Destination."  Normal usage of Sword Project tools in Linux/UNIX environments includes
			one's personal area, under ~/.sword, plus a shared system-wide area readable by all users.  If the user does not
			have write access to the system area, that selection will be greyed-out and unavailable.
			</para>

			<para>
			There have been some requests for <application>GnomeSword</application> to provide a means by which an ordinary
			(non-root) user could start the program, gain temporary write access to the system area while installing modules,
			and then revoke that access after installation is complete.  Attempting to devise a scheme to do this has proven
			quite difficult, given the different superuser management schemes employed by various Linux distributions.
			Therefore, at this time there are no ongoing plans to try to solve this problem, and users are advised to enable
			write access to the system area outside <application>GnomeSword</application>.

		Archival is available for any module, although it is provided with personal commentaries specifically in mind.  A *.zip of

		<para>
		Some resource modules in Sword Project format are available from sources other than Crosswire.  Necessarily, installing such
		a module is a manual task.
		</para>
		<para>
		Modules are normally packaged as *.zip files; they contain a configuration file plus a number of data files.  Installation
		of such a module is done by cd'ing to your personal Sword (not <application>GnomeSword</application>) configuration
		directory, ~/.sword, and unzipping the file there.  The configuration file will be left in "mods.d", and the module's data
		files will go into a subdirectory of "modules".  Alternatively, if you have write access to the system Sword directory,
		typically /usr/share/sword, you may cd there instead before unzipping.
		</para>
		<para>
		Restart <application>GnomeSword</application> after installing such a module, so that a fresh instance of the program can
		notice the new module in place.
