you can start gnomesword with command line options
1. gnomesword newconfigs - this will create a new configuration file
with default settings - if gnomesword will not start this might help
2. gnomesword newbookmarks - this will create a new bookmark file should
the old get messed up.
3. gnomesword newfiles - this will create both the above files

GnomeSword started life as the Sword Project cheatah program.

I took the code for setting the scope of a search from
the Bibletime program.

I have taken some code form the Sword Project's windoze
programs also. 


I wish to thank the folks who have put so much time and work into the
Sword Project and then giving it to the world! God Bless you!

If you look at my code you will be glad to know that I make my living
as a preacher - not a programmer.
