Xiphos started life as the Sword Project's Cheatah program.

Over the course of Xiphos development many ideas and some pieces of
code have come from the Bibletime program and the Sword Project's 
BibleCS program.

We wish to thank the folks who have put so much time and work into the
Sword Project and then giving it to the world! God Bless you!


We hope that your Bible Study will be enhanced by Xiphos.
