GnomeSword requires Gome and the Sword libs to run

you can do some formatting of your personal notes
text inclosed in <B></b> will be bold - ctrl+b
text inclosed in <I></i> will be italic - ctrl+i
text inclosed in <FONT FACE="symbol"></font> will use the symbol font (greek) - ctrl+g
text formatted like <a href=\"Romans 8:28">Romans 8:28</a> will be red (for Bible references) - ctrl+r
you can also mark for underline - ctrl+l - but gnomesword will not show underline - now.
when in edit mode you will see the format marks in the editor
you must higlight the text you want marked - then use the keys or the popup menu to apply
the tags.
The formatting is different form the last release - I hope this does not cause a problem.
I changed to make the personal comments compatible with BibleTime.
you can turn formatting on or off in the preferences dialog

******************************************************************
you can start gnomesword with command line options
1. gnomesword newconfigs - this will create a new configuration file
with default settings - if gnomesword will not start this might help
2. gnomesword newbookmarks - this will create a new bookmark file should
the old get messed up.
3. gnomesword newfiles - this will create both the above files
******************************************************************

GnomeSword started life as the Sword Project cheatah program and
some of the cheatah code is still used in GnomeSword.

I took the code for setting the scope of a search from
the Bibletime program.

I think I may have taken some code form the Sword Project's windoze
programs also.

The printing code is from gedit-0.7.9. I only change what I had to to
make it work with GnomeSword.

The code for spell checking is from gaspell

The code for the shortcut bar is from the Evolution project without
any changes - I just copied the subdirs 'e-util' and 'widgets' into
the gnomesword dir.

I wish to thank the folks who have put so much time and work into the
Sword Project and then giving it to the world! God Bless you!

If you look at my code you will be glad to know that I make my living
as a preacher - not a programmer.
