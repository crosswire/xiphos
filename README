If you have mozilla-1.0.1 or later and you have the development 
packages or installed from source you can run configure with the
--enable-gtkembedmoz option. If it works on your system it will give
you right to left support for Hebrew.

******************************************************************
you can start gnomesword with command line options
1. gnomesword newconfigs - this will create a new configuration file
with default settings - if gnomesword will not start this might help
2. gnomesword newbookmarks - this will create a new bookmark file should
the old get messed up.
3. gnomesword newfiles - this will create both the above files
******************************************************************

GnomeSword started life as the Sword Project's Cheatah program.

Over the course of GnomeSword development many ideas and some pieces of
code have come from the Bibletime program and the Sword Project's 
BibleCS program.

We wish to thank the folks who have put so much time and work into the
Sword Project and then giving it to the world! God Bless you!


We hope that your Bible Study will be enhanced by GnomeSword.
