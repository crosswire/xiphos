Note:
The NIV does not work right with GnomeSword. So far I have had no
problem viewing the text - the problem is searching. GomeSword will
crash if you try to search the NIV. I can search Gen to Job and
Prov to Rev without a problem, but if I include Psa in the search
the program crashes.

I can work around this on my system by removing the 'SourceType=GBF'
line from the niv.conf file. All works well then.

If you use Bibletime this work around will cause the Titles in Psalms
to look like part of the text.

If there is a way to fix this please let me know.

GnomeSword started life as the Sword Project cheatah program and
some of the cheatah code is still used in GnomeSword.

I took the code for setting the scope of a search from
the Bibletime program.

I think I may have taken some code form the Sword Project's windoze
programs also.

The printing code is from gedit-0.7.9. I only change what I had to to
make it work with GnomeSword.

The code for spell checking is from gaspell

I wish to thank the folks who have put so much time and work into the
Sword Project and then giving it to the world! God Bless you!

If you look at my code you will be glad to know that I make my living
as a preacher - not a programmer.
