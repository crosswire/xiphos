GNOMESWORD RELEASE NOTES
________________________

Release 2.2.1 (maintenance)
27 Jan 2007

Behavioral matters:

1. Genbooks now use a navbar in both dialog and Book View pane.
2. High-contrast highlight of current verse is available.
   (Edit->Prefs->Fonts->Colors, plus either View->Highlight Current Verse
    or Edit->Prefs->General->Misc->Highlight current verse.)
3. Unused verse number color preference was removed, as planned
   (feat.req #1620641).
4. Footnote content search works again, but it's a hack, it still uses
   an atrocious syntax, and we still need to do the planned rework in
   Advanced Search (feat.req #1615402).
5. Disabling both right-side panes completely disables right-side display
   (bug #1624753, feat.req #1624757).
6. GnomeSword enables GConf-based URL handling (feat.req #1613239).
7. There is code in place to do double-space text as soon as GTKMOZEMBED
   returns (feat.req #1193235).  #ifdef DOUBLESPACE keeps the View item
   out of visibility for the moment.  Improved Strong's/morph markup
   (feat.req #1633426) will follow soon.  Both depend on CSS.
8. Some new keyboard shortcuts have appeared (feat.req #1633397).  Alt-G
   focuses on the Genbook navbar, and thereafter arrow keys do what you
   expect.  Ctrl-L focuses the main verse navbar text.

Important usage note:

A genbook key handling bug exists in the Sword libs, in SVN after
their 1.5.9 release.  If you build Sword from SVN and you find that
you are unable to navigate to certain portions of some genbooks
(Finney, Heretics, Institutes), a workaround is this, for each module:
    cd ~/.sword/modules/genbook/rawgenbook/finney
    mod2imp Finney > finney.imp
    imp2gbs finney.imp
    rm finney.imp
That is, simple re-importation will make the module consistent with
itself in this regard.

Release 2.2
25 Dec 2006

Known deficiencies:

1. Footnote body search was very recently broken by other needed work
   in Advanced Search.  Other "attribute" searches (esp. Strong's
   refs) work, but not footnote body search.  This will be addressed
   early in the next development cycle: Advanced Search is due for
   another round of revamping, largely to simplify and enhance the
   operation of attribute searches.  See feature request #1615402.

2. The alternate HTML renderer code under the "mozembed" #ifdef is
   not functional at this time, and we do not know if such capability
   will return in a future release.  This means that the configure
   options --with-firefox and --with-seamonkey do not function.

3. The verse number font color preference is ignored; this will go
   away entirely soon, as verse numbers are links to themselves, for
   re-aligning verse navigation to the verse in question, which in
   turn tracks the commentary to the same verse.  See feature request
   #1620641.

4. The module manager offers installation directory options of
   ~/.sword as well as the system Sword directory, typically
   /usr/share/sword, iff that directory is writable by the user.
   Future work will involve efforts at a superuser password query
   to obtain temporary access to the system directory, but in the
   current release, "chown -R you.yourgroup" is necessary, prior to
   running GnomeSword.  See feature request #1618837.

Bug reports addressed since 2.1.10:
1620542  Crashes on "View Context"
1618998  Displays frame then hangs
1618829  first use: no global modules found by gnomesword
1618324  "philipper" in german version points to philemon
1617225  gnomesword crashes, when clicking on combobox...
1613439  Sidebar setting does not survive program restart

Feature requests pending:
1620641  "Verse numbers" font color is ignored
1620313  Couple of bugs with module manager operation
1618837  global install of modules
1615402  advanced search needs help
1613239  improve command line use of "sword://"
1194044  prayer list
1193235  Allow text to be displayed double space
1124274  GnomeSword for Windows
 901894  Drop book list for search limit
Requests 1613239 and above are post-2.1.10 release.  Older requests
represent capabilities for which the needed underlying support does
not exist or which represent an extremely complicated re-working of
GnomeSword from its current state.

the middle of the 2.1 development cycle at a time when many very old
bug reports were finally addressed.
