XIPHOS RELEASE NOTES
____________________

Release 3.0
06 Feb 2009

Xiphos begins life, as the former GnomeSword.

We have changed our name to Xiphos because GnomeSword was deemed too
obscure, especially considering our anticipated new user base.  Xiphos
("ξίφος") is one of several Greek words for "sword".  Pronunciation of
the name Xiphos can be learned from a sample audio file you will find
in share/doc/xiphos; approximately, "ksee-fos."

This release represents a huge new chapter in our program's life.

Problems known for this release.

 1. Linux:
    a. In the most recent Fedora and Ubuntu releases, the invocation of
       the editor (personal commentary, prayer list/journal) will induce
       several harmless warning messages to occur.

 2. Windows:
    a. Xiphos runs under Windows 2000, XP, Vista, and 7-beta.
    b. A few additional fonts are included with the installer (FreeSerif
       and LinuxLibertine) and they are correctly installed, but they may
       not immediately become available on installation completion.  We
       do not yet understand why.  At worst, a reboot is needed.
    c. The module list "treeview" sometimes becomes unnavigable by mouse
       clicks.  This seems to be a Windows-specific flaw in the port of
       the GTK library which drives the treeview.  If it occurs, it will
       be evident as soon as Xiphos starts; simply restart it.
    d. The font used in the previewer should reflect the intended font of
       the module whose content is being previewed there.  If Xiphos
       starts up with the previewer embedded in the sidebar, then such
       font choices are not properly respected.

Major new features, operational improvements, and bugfixes:

 1. Windows port.  It is very nearly complete; only a couple features
    are missing.  Most notably, they are the MozEmbed display engine
    and the "read aloud" facility using Festival text-to-speech.  We
    anticipate both of these features becoming available in a later
    3.x release but there was simply not enough time to get everything
    done for this release.

 2. A fabulous new look, with the support of professional graphics
    designers having done a facelift of our graphics, both in the
    program and on the website.

 3. Configure with --enable-paratab to obtain the detached parallel
    window as another tab and to put the previewer into the sidebar.
    See the View menu.

 4. Standard module repository setup for first-time users.

 5. Image resize enabled by default.

 6. Commentary-by-chapter display, as a commentary module option,
    rather than just per-verse commentary.

 7. Consistent dialog usages: Y/N questions and file browsers.

 8. Module manager: Remembers previous settings.  New remote source is
    set as current.  Tooltips over icons in module manager lists.
    Visual improvements by showing repository in use and separating
    full module lists from limited update/uninstalled lists.  Now
    functions correctly with both shared and personal storage areas.

 9. Compatibility with forthcoming Sword engine updates for dynamic
    versification ("dv11n").  Future modules will support e.g.
    deuterocanonical books in Catholic Bibles.

10. More uniform module option support in parallel window.

11. Dictionary links auto-display in the previewer, after the
    fashion of Strong's and morphology references.

12. Better Help menu selections: Online chat support, bug reporting,
    mailing list pointers.

13. Better search term highlighting in both sidebar and dialog search.

14. Double-click navigation of search results entries.

15. Improved/fixed search abort.  Assume "AND" semantic for sidebar
    multiple word search.

16. Countless internal cleanups, efficiency improvements, and
    bugfixes, the need for many of which was exposed by the Windows
    port effort.

17. Additions to the manual, especially for instruction on original
    language research and how to get help.

18. Better integration of image support with ImageMagick libraries.

19. Respect for configuration-specified font choices (Font= and
    Fontsize= in module configuration files).

20. Improvements to build-time configuration support.

21. Fixed fast search ("lucene") index creation.
    NOTE: The implication of this bugfix is that any existing
    index is in error.  You should re-create all module indexes.

Bug reports addressed since 2.4.1:
2264199  Long custom Module lists make search gui too wide

________________________

Release 2.4.1
05 Nov 2008

Ongoing requested feature enhancements in stable 2.4.

 1. GnomeSword now takes control of sword:// URLs without asking any
    question, iff there was previously no handler for them.  (In a
    debug build, the question is still asked, but with better phrasing.)

 2. Intermediate module paths for prayer lists are properly constructed.

 3. GnomeSword can be built under Solaris (--enable-gtkhtml3 only).

 4. Ctrl-F "find" capability: Without a Bible pane, it operates in
    comm/book pane; without that, it operates in dictionary pane.

 5. Advanced Search provides search term highlight in result preview.
    Also, the Find button toggles to Stop during a search.

 6. New icons, courtesy of Simon Meers.

 7. Module configuration default font specifications.  If a configuration
    contains "Font=Some Font Name" or "Fontsize=+2", GnomeSword will
    respect that as a default.  The user can change it of course, but any
    time the user resorts to default font name or +0 size, module
    configuration takes over.

 8. Companion modules: If a Bible or commentary has configuration file
    element Companion=OtherModule, then GnomeSword will offer to open
    that module as well when opening the first module.

 9. F1-F4 provide help, preferences, advanced search, and module manager.

Bug reports addressed since 2.4.0:
2163853  Scrolling Issues
2186692  GnomeSword cannot create module's path

New feature requests pending:
2190241  keys should work normally

________________________

Release 2.4.0 -stable-
20 Sep 2008

Moving past the "development" 2.3 line to "stable" 2.4 with these updates
in the post-2.3.6 shakedown:

 1. Journal/prayer list support is enabled by default.

 2. Selecting choices for Strong's modules is now complete, and Preferences
    comboboxes have gained an instructive "--Select--" first entry.

 3. New translations, Swedish and Hebrew.

 4. Sort capability in mod.mgr has been disabled (contextually pointless).

 5. Module deletions are reflected immediately in list on completion.

 6. An error in tab labeling has been fixed.

 7. Phrasing in several areas was improved for translation ease and clarity.

 8. Ctrl-plus/minus change the base font size.

 9. Naming change: "Pinned" tabs => "linked" tabs.

10. '_' is accepted in module naming (journals/prayer lists/pers.comm).

11. Search results are clearable in advanced search.

12. Mouse activity is ignored during long-running mod.mgr actions.

13. An ancient mem.alloc glitch in genbook modnames was fixed.

14. The passage exporter is enabled by default; --enable-exporter is no
    longer needed.

15. The Help menu contains a reference to Translation, to solicit others'
    help in making GnomeSword more accessible to more language groups.

16. Navbar load glitch when switching between 1- and 2-testament Bibles
    has been fixed.

Bug reports addressed since 2.3.6:
2036800  Prayer list/journal name only accepts English
2040344  module manager needs to lock left panel
2040347  adv.search can't clear results
2069455  module deletion not reflected in list
2069476  sorting by module name contains categories
2079930  Strongs Hebrew/Greek numbers don't lookup
2084401  Problem compiling with xul-1.9/firefox 3 on Debian/Gentoo
2105812  main navbar wrongly loaded when switching

New feature requests pending:
2053524  Port to Maemo OS2008 (Internet Tablet)

Feature requests closed:
2056615  Option to hide verse numbers
________________________

Release 2.3.6
02 Aug 2008

 1. In the module manager, along with the usual per-module-type
    categorization of modules, the mod.mgr also produces a parallel
    per-availability categorization, for updated and uninstalled
    modules.  This makes it easier to find new stuff, rather than having
    to crawl through all the per-type listings.

 2. The module manager alphabetizes the available language selections.
    Also, locale-specific language names are in all module lists.
    (Note for Cygwin: The Cygwin pango library is buggy, tripping over
    some valid UTF-8...by aborting.  *sigh*  For this reason, it has been
    necessary to cripple Cygwin's use of locale-specific language names.)

 3. General books' bookmarks are generated using the key text rather
    than an arcane internal numeric module offset.

 4. Devotionals open to today's MM.DD key, rather than attempting
    (and always failing) to open on the current dictionary key.

 5. An Advanced Search bug has been fixed, which caused failure when a
    custom list contained a deleted module.

 6. Genbook navbar tooltips have been made a bit more understandable.

 7. Main verse navigation has keyboard shorcuts on variations of N/P.

 8. The personal commentary editor can be invoked with Alt-Z.

 9. Locked modules' cipher keys are stored correctly.

10. Image, Map, and Daily Devotional modules no longer appear in more
    than one module list.

11. Prayer lists have expanded to include a general journal concept; a
    few crash bugs have been fixed, and templates for journals & topical
    outlines are available.  These user-editable modules seem now to be
    suitable for general user-driven module creation in genbook format.

12. The Advanced Search dialog's Find button also stops a search.

13. Almost 8000 language abbrev names are known, for module list purposes.

14. Comboboxes in Preferences now limit dictionary subcategories correctly
    (i.e. HebrewDef, GreekDef, Daily Devotionals).

Bug reports addressed since 2.3.5:
1973928  key entry not saved in .conf
1994431  seg fault when incorrect source
2033166  Same selection in more combo boxes

New feature requests pending:
2009652  studypad should be able to save as plain text

Feature requests closed:
1991842  Some suggestions for personal commentary
2009885  Cancel a search
________________________

Release 2.3.5
02 Jul 2008

Mostly an urgent bugfix release.

1. GnomeSword can now link with the gtkhtml-3.23.2 API, so as no
   longer to require the Bonobo editor (but still backward-compatible
   to those systems needing it).

2. A couple small glitches noticed immediately post-2.3.4 have been fixed.

3. A serious search bug, in which a change in Sword's behavior was not
   being correctly handled in GnomeSword, has been fixed.

4. A failure to build in some environments (esp. Ubuntu) has been fixed.

5. Display of n:0 editorial content is stopped when headings are disabled.

6. An infloop bug was fixed, induced by Adv.Search being open when an
   xref is clicked.

Bug reports addressed since 2.3.4:
1973933  per-module font size not respected in parallel view tab
1977884  GS_StringMgr crash on attribute search
1991836  Segmentation fault
1995108  Segmentation Fault While Searching
1999299  GodsWord ver 1.2 module appears corrupt
2008263  Searching Segfault

New feature requests pending:
1991842  Some suggestions for personal commentary
1994953  Fine tune display settings

Feature requests closed:
1994956  Previewer settings
________________________

Release 2.3.4
26 May 2008

1. Primary/secondary reading selections, used mostly in Greek Bibles to
   identify variant readings found in ancient MSS, is functional for the
   first time.

2. Prayer list support is enabled in the Preferences dialog.  Several
   varieties of prayer list are then available by right-clicking the
   new element in the modules list.

3. Per-module font face choices are respected in detached parallel view
   (mozembed build only; gtkhtml3 can't cope with multiple faces).

4. Module manager remembers last settings.

5. A passage exporter facility is now available on the right-click menu,
   if GnomeSword is configured with --enable-exporter.

6. GnomeSword can now be built against the xulrunner display engine,
   as a replacement for MozEmbed.  However, xulrunner has been shown to
   be fundamentally broken at this time, and we do not recommend it.

GnomeSword now requires Sword 1.5.11.

Bug reports addressed since 2.3.3:
1747281  2.3: can't drag-n-drop from adv.search [unresolvable]
1863160  efficiency: full module cache usage

________________________

Release 2.3.3
20 Jan 2008

1. Module manager supports display of InstallSize qualifiers from
   *.conf, when provided by the repository's modules.  This allows users
   to make informed decisions about whether to spend link time or disc
   space for modules.

2. Improved algorithm for displaying complex lemma content so as not
   to display overlapping words.

3. Non-"latinate arabic" numerals are supported for LC_ALL=fa to go with
   general Farsi translation.  This is inherently incomplete, because
   location bars still must display regular digits.  However, verse numbers
   in text, navbar spinners, and most other contexts are displayed
   accordingly.

4. Updated special-case NASB lexicon names (soon, very soon, we hope) and
   adjust/fix/neuter weird embedded `!' in their refs.

5. Module manager now supports "local" install, that is, if you have
   a directory of modules to install in appropriate format.  Commonly
   expected for use with e.g. distribution cdroms.  This has never
   been tested/working before now.

6. Image content can now be disabled on demand from the right-click menu.
   This option does not become available until the first time that
   GnomeSword notices that there have been images in the content.

Bug reports addressed since 2.3.2:
1870036  mod.mgr cannot do local installs
1864007  NASB's lexicon refs need adjustment
1860365  lemma display hack is very poor

New feature requests pending:
<none>

Feature requests closed:
1869036  need farsi numerals
1860685  mod.mgr should support InstallSize in *.conf
________________________

Release 2.3.2
26 Dec 2007

This is an intermediate bugfix release, to correct a small number of
varyingly important or long-standing issues.

1. Drag-n-drop from adv.search almost works again: Keys containing `/'
   or whitespace were not being processed correctly, and the gecko
   subsystem was simply not accepting the request.  However, there is
   still a problem in MozEmbed where, once a gecko element (any of the
   main subwindows) has had focus, drag-n-drop cannot complete and the
   program, and possibly the desktop, are hung -- there is a gtk signal
   connection problem yet to be understood fully.  (This problem is
   MozEmbed-specific and does not occur in gtkhtml at all.)

2. Core dumps in adv.search induced by offset handling in lexdicts
   and genbooks were eliminated.

3. Image resizing is not disabled just because one image failed.
   Complaints on image resize failure are made just once per page.

4. Fit gconf setup dialog strings into a smaller text box.

Bug reports addressed since 2.3.1:
1857805  Bug report when starting gnomesword2
1855521  Build failure with xulrunner-1.9-beta2
1830932  strcasestr() is nonstandard, more than just cygwin
1830919  test before adding g++ options to flags
1828280  Text not translated
1824138  no lexdict => crash or log complaints
1808047  Czech translation -- grammatical error
1802257  highlighting will be case sensitive even if the search isn't
1781816  2.3 gtkhtml3 integration bugs
1747281  2.3: can't drag-n-drop from adv.search

New feature requests pending:
<none>

________________________

Release 2.3.1
14 Oct 2007

This is a test and evaluation release.

Today's 2.3 is a test release of the replacement and re-integration of
the old gtkhtml3 display engine with the new MozEmbed display engine.
Thus, version 2.2 is officially defunct, an evolutionary dead end.  As
such, the 2.3 series of releases, which we hope to be mercifully short
until stability can be again declared when released as 2.4, represents
a major functional change from 2.2, mostly internally, but nonetheless
with quite a number of user-visible changes.

See the manual, especially section 3.9, "Version Differences in
GnomeSword's Display," for details on what is different between
gtkhtml3 and MozEmbed.  MozEmbed provides a fundamentally prettier and
friendlier interface.  Note that not all platforms have adequate, or
any, MozEmbed support, e.g. Fedora Core 5 has some MozEmbed support,
but it is too out of date and buggy for GnomeSword's use; Windows with
Cygwin lacks MozEmbed entirely.  On such platforms, configure with
--enable-gtkhtml.  (On Cygwin, --enable-cygwin is necessary, and
includes configuration of gtkhtml3.)

GnomeSword requires underlying Sword support at version 1.5.10 or later.

Behavioral matters:

 1. The splash screen is enabled by default, especially for benefit of
    first-time users.

 2. Subwindow visibility state (Bible, commentary/genbook, previewer,
    dictionary, all selected from the View menu) is now maintained on a
    per-tab basis, rather than simply as global state.  Existing tabs
    files are auto-updated when they are first used, with current
    global state applied to all tabs, and then the tabs file is re-saved.

 3. Doublespace text and blocked Strong's+morph (only with MozEmbed).

 4. Book and chapter headings in Bibles, stored in modules as
    pseudoverses in 0:0 (per book) and n:0 (per chapter), are presented
    when headings are enabled.

 5. A new navbar has been implemented that looks generally better.
    That said, it appears not to look so good on Cygwin, with older GTK
    support; consider configuring with --enable-old_navbar there.

 6. Indices needed for fast "lucene" searches can now be built from
    the module manager.  An icon indicates the presence of a
    ready-for-use index.  Also, the module manager's appearance has been
    generally re-arranged to be a bit more functional and intuitive: The
    "remove" panel is now a general "maintenance" panel, and the
    "configure" and "sources" panels have been swapped.

 7. A base font size has been implemented; see Preferences.  All
    module font size choices are relative to this base.

 8. Daily Devotionals now get their own subtree in module lists in the
    sidebar and module manager.

 9. In line with newly-defined module configuration keywords and
    qualifiers, there are now also Maps and Images subtrees.

10. Additional keyboard shortcuts: Alt-B bookmark dialog, Alt-P detach
    parallel dialog window.

11. Locale names have been updated to accommodate more recent versions
    of existing modules (e.g. Farsi, Haitian Creole, Burmese, others).

12. "About" boxes for modules handle UTF-8 properly.

13. Duplicate install sources are now refused.

14. A module cache bug regarding mis-cached headers has been fixed.

15. A font error in highlighted verses was fixed.

16. "About GnomeSword" is a bit more informative and useful, showing
    GnomeSword's web site as well as the display engine with which
    GnomeSword was built (gtkhtml3 -vs- MozEmbed).

17. Both old style multi-word search and optimized ("lucene") search
    are available in advanced search.  Sidebar search is optimized,
    with a tooltip to assist on need for +First +Second for multi-word.

18. Many translation updates, plus new translations (e.g. Portuguese).

Known, unresolved flaws in this unstable test release:
1781816  gtkhtml3 integration bugs
	 (various problems specific to gtkhtml3 builds, involving
	  failure to follow mouse clicks in certain circumstances)
1747281  can't drag-n-drop from adv.search
	 (in either gtkhtml3 or MozEmbed, d&d has stopped working)

________________________

Release 2.2.3
24 Mar 2007

1. A module cache has been implemented as a significant performance
   improvement.  As Bible text is visited, everything seen goes into
   an in-memory cache, so that subsequent navigation of the same text
   does not need to re-visit Sword.  If display options change
   (footnotes xrefs headings Strong's morph), the cache is invalidated
   and Sword is queried again to re-populate the display-ready cache.

   Display performance acid test:
     KJV Ps 119 (176 verses), all mod.opts enabled; spin verse selector.
     End-to-end (v1 -> v176) navigation time on 1.8GHz computer:
     GS 2.2.2, 441sec; GS 2.2.3, 102sec => 78% reduction.

2. Personal commentary archival, renaming, and verse dump are implemented
   (feat.req #1633407).  Archival is available via the module manager
   (any module may be archived); rename + dump are on the pers.comm
   popup menu.  [For Cygwin, regrets, NTFS prevents rename of files
   currently open, so module rename is not available there; but archive
   + dump are fine.]

3. Main window image content can be clicked to invoke an external image
   viewer (feat.req #1631815).  Support for this feature requires an
   enhancement to Sword itself beyond its 1.5.9 release (i.e. built from
   SVN at change level >= -r2035), but of course it builds/runs fine
   without this feature's availability using today's Sword 1.5.9.  Some
   day (soon?), Troy will release a new 1.5.something, or perhaps 1.6,
   which will contain this.

4. Finnish translation now available.

5. Sidebar verse lists are always savable (bug #1674149).

6. Improving i18n support now supports more non-ASCII searches
   (bug #1673598).

7. Mouse-selected Bible/commentary/genbook text can be read aloud using
   a popup menu selection, regardless of whether scripture reading is
   enabled on View -> Read Aloud.

Bug reports addressed since 2.2.2:
1687602  Module Manager crashes on FC6
1681135  Module manager crashes Gnomesword on startup
1674149  unable to save verse lists

Release 2.2.2 (maintenance)
23 Feb 2007

Behavioral matters:

1. The module manager now provides both short module name plus long
   module description on the right, and there is also a refresh icon
   between mismatched old & new version stamps of installed modules
   (bug #1666761).  GnomeSword now works around a Sword lib install
   manager bug when updating installed modules by deleting the old
   version before attempting to retrieve the new version (bug #1666748).
2. Several MM glitches related to unfindable or unusable newly-defined
   install sources have been fixed (bug #1666763, #1666759).
3. Some of the planned Advanced Search work has been done (feat.req
   #1615402).  E.g. you can select the Attributes radio button, then
   use the Attribute tab to define which attribute is in question.
   The Strong's syntax needed is now just H### or G###.
4. Many changes for improving i18n handling have been done.  (We need
   translators.)
5. The 2x2 set of buttons at the bottom of the sidebar have been moved
   to the top, where they sit near the rest of the mouse controls
   (bug #1666764).
6. GnomeSword can now build under MS-Windows in the Cygwin environment
   (feat.req #1124274), and gives every appearance of being fully
   functional there.  Doing so requires a bash script and two library tar
   files.  See ftp://ftp.kleinpaste.org/pub/sword/util/cygwin/

Bug reports addressed since 2.2.1:
1666764  sidebar buttons belong at top
1666763  MM loses track of newly-defined sources

Release 2.2.1 (maintenance)
27 Jan 2007

Behavioral matters:

1. Genbooks now use a navbar in both dialog and Book View pane.
2. High-contrast highlight of current verse is available.
   (Edit->Prefs->Fonts->Colors, plus either View->Highlight Current Verse
    or Edit->Prefs->General->Misc->Highlight current verse.)
3. Unused verse number color preference was removed, as planned
   (feat.req #1620641).
4. Footnote content search works again, but it's a hack, it still uses
   an atrocious syntax, and we still need to do the planned rework in
   Advanced Search (feat.req #1615402).
5. Disabling both right-side panes completely disables right-side display
   (bug #1624753, feat.req #1624757).
6. GnomeSword enables GConf-based URL handling (feat.req #1613239).
7. There is code in place to do double-space text as soon as GTKMOZEMBED
   returns (feat.req #1193235).  #ifdef DOUBLESPACE keeps the View item
   out of visibility for the moment.  Improved Strong's/morph markup
   (feat.req #1633426) will follow soon.  Both depend on CSS.
8. Some new keyboard shortcuts have appeared (feat.req #1633397).  Alt-G
   focuses on the Genbook navbar, and thereafter arrow keys do what you
   expect.  Alt-C brings up the commentary.  Ctrl-L focuses the main
   verse navbar text.

Important usage note:

A genbook key handling bug exists in the Sword libs, in SVN after
their 1.5.9 release.  If you build Sword from SVN and you find that
you are unable to navigate to certain portions of some genbooks
(Finney, Heretics, Institutes), a workaround is this, for each module:
    cd ~/.sword/modules/genbook/rawgenbook/finney
    mod2imp Finney > finney.imp
    imp2gbs finney.imp
    rm finney.imp
That is, simple re-importation will make the module consistent with
itself in this regard.

Release 2.2
25 Dec 2006

Known deficiencies:

1. Footnote body search was very recently broken by other needed work
   in Advanced Search.  Other "attribute" searches (esp. Strong's
   refs) work, but not footnote body search.  This will be addressed
   early in the next development cycle: Advanced Search is due for
   another round of revamping, largely to simplify and enhance the
   operation of attribute searches.  See feature request #1615402.

2. The alternate HTML renderer code under the "mozembed" #ifdef is
   not functional at this time, and we do not know if such capability
   will return in a future release.  This means that the configure
   options --with-firefox and --with-seamonkey do not function.

3. The verse number font color preference is ignored; this will go
   away entirely soon, as verse numbers are links to themselves, for
   re-aligning verse navigation to the verse in question, which in
   turn tracks the commentary to the same verse.  See feature request
   #1620641.

4. The module manager offers installation directory options of
   ~/.sword as well as the system Sword directory, typically
   /usr/share/sword, iff that directory is writable by the user.
   Future work will involve efforts at a superuser password query
   to obtain temporary access to the system directory, but in the
   current release, "chown -R you.yourgroup" is necessary, prior to
   running GnomeSword.  See feature request #1618837.

Bug reports addressed since 2.1.10:
1620542  Crashes on "View Context"
1618998  Displays frame then hangs
1618829  first use: no global modules found by gnomesword
1618324  "philipper" in german version points to philemon
1617225  gnomesword crashes, when clicking on combobox...
1613439  Sidebar setting does not survive program restart

Feature requests pending:
1620641  "Verse numbers" font color is ignored
1620313  Couple of bugs with module manager operation
1618837  global install of modules
1615402  advanced search needs help
1613239  improve command line use of "sword://"
1194044  prayer list
1193235  Allow text to be displayed double space
1124274  GnomeSword for Windows
 901894  Drop book list for search limit
Requests 1613239 and above are post-2.1.10 release.  Older requests
represent capabilities for which the needed underlying support does
not exist or which represent an extremely complicated re-working of
GnomeSword from its current state.

the middle of the 2.1 development cycle at a time when many very old
bug reports were finally addressed.
