These files, biblesync.{cc,hh}, are the last commits of the BibleSync code
before it was removed from Xiphos itself so as to become its own
independent library.  They are used iff libbiblesync.so is not available.
When BibleSync becomes a readily-available library, it will be removed
from Xiphos' source tree.
