# Xiphos

Xiphos is a Bible study application for Linux, UNIX, and Windows operating

texts and images. Xiphos includes features such as, searching, biblesync,
bookmarks, parallel study, and original language study.

## Building Xiphos

Please see the INSTALL file.


## History and Acknowledgements

Xiphos started life as the Sword Project's Cheatah program.

Over the course of Xiphos development many ideas and some pieces of code have
come from the Bibletime program and the Sword Project's BibleCS program.

We wish to thank the folks who have put so much time and work into the Sword
Project and then giving it to the world! God Bless you!


## Developing Xiphos


If you want to help develop Xiphos your help will be very appreciated!

The first steps would be to make yourself familiar with the Xiphos build
process, so go read the INSTALL file.

If you are looking for things to do, the best place to find out is to jump into
the #xiphos channel of irc.freenode.net

If you make changes to C or C++ files, please make sure they are cleaned up to
follow our style of coding. The best way to make sure of it is to run this:

	$ clang-format -i -style=file /path/to/edited.c

Where /path/to/edited.c, the C or C++ file you edited. The option '-style=file'
uses a predefined style file called .clang-format in the source tree.


## Thank you!


We hope that your Bible study will be enhanced by Xiphos!
