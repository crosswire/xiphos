Documentation Guidelines
---------------------------------------
Welcome to the GnomeSword documentation guidelines.
This document will contain some guidelines for writing/submitting a good patch
to the GnomeSword documentation project.

Any new features or large scale work should first be discussed on the
gnomesword-developers mailing-list first.  This will ensure the idea fits in the
direction we wish to take GnomeSword, and also that the effort is not
duplicated.

-----------------
General:
-----------------
1. Please read the Gnome Documentation Project guidelines. If you would like a copy of it
in PDF format, please email one of the Documentation developers. 

2. Whilst editing, you can view your changes by simply going into your working directory and running :
	" yelp filename.xml" 

This also helps with finding errors and debugging. 

-----------------
Files:
----------------
1. gnomesword-manual.xml is the main file to the documentation. All chapter are linked from here. It acts
as a contents page. The interface section's within GnomeSword are broken up into smaller more manageable 
files which are listed within this file. If a new section is to be added to the manual eg. "Advanced Search dialogs",
this needs to be mentioned in here. 

2. Files are broken up into groups of interface categories. If you wish to edit the preferences dialog documentation, just 
simply edit the "preferences.xml" file.

------------------
Screenshots:
-------------------
1. screenshots will only be accepted if it is in the "Traditional" theme. It can be
accessed by going:

	Applications -> Desktop Preferences -> Theme
	or 
	by simply running the command "gnome-theme-manager" in the terminal.

This is to comply with the Gnome Documentation Project standards. 

2.Please use discretion about image sizes. This includes file size and images size ( length
and height). While there is no rule or standard to how big the image must be, visibility of the
screenshot and visibility within "Yelp" is the main priority. We don't want to user to scroll horizontally
just to view a screenshot. I normally keep my screenshot width at a maximum of 600 pixels.

3.file naming will be done with the prefix of the interface ( eg. preferences, underscore, interface subsection ( eg. font-color ) 
eg. " preferences_fontscolor.png"
NOTE: please use lower-case.
