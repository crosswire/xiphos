HOW TO ADD A NEW TRANSLATION TO GNOMESWORD
------------------------------------------

We welcome new translations, but please be aware that translations 
are not just one time jobs. They have to be maintained in order to 
be useful. Otherwise they quickly get outdated and become obsolete, 
and useless. That said, we would be happy if you could maintain 
a new documentation translation.


Preparation
-----------
Make sure you have the GNU gettext package installed.
Grab the latest versions of the source files of GnomeSword in 
Subversion :
$ svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnomesword/trunk gnomesword


Translating GnomeSword Application
---------------------------------- 
# The translation files are in the po/ directory
Go to the po directory:
$ cd po

# The gnomesword.pot file contains the strings to be located
Update the pot file :
$ intltool-update --pot

# Copy the gnomesword.pot file to YOUR-LANG.po file:
YOUR-LANG = LL_CC combination.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter 
language code, and `CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.
`LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL' to denote the language's 
main dialect  
For example, let's suppose that you speak Portuguese, pt_BR.po is the 
name of YOUR-LANG.po file if you live in Brazil, but pt.po if you 
live in Portugal, 
$ cp gnomesword.pot YOUR-LANG.po

# Add YOUR-LANG to the LINGUAS file:
$ echo " YOUR-LANG" >> LINGUAS

# Editing the file manually (emacs, vi, gedit) or with one of the available 
programs for this (gtranslator, poedit, emacs po mode...), creating the 
translation:
$ vi YOUR-LANG.po

# Check the file for errors (IMPORTANT! Don't forget this step):
$ msgfmt -cv -o /dev/null xy.po

You are now ready to compile GnomeSword and check the result of your work.


Translating GnomeSword Manual
-----------------------------

# The help files are in the help/ directory
Go to the help/ directory
$ cd help

# There is a directory per YOUR-LANG
Create your own directory
# mkdir YOUR-LANG

# Edit Makefile.am and add YOUR-LANG to DOC_LINGUAS
$ vi Makefile.am

# Goto YOUR-LANG/ directory
$ cd YOUR-LANG/

# Generate po files. For more information on xml2po, check the output 
of xml2po --help and man xml2po
$ xml2po -e -o YOUR-LANG.po ../C/*xml

# Editing the file manually (emacs, vi, gedit) or with one of the available 
programs for this (gtranslator, poedit, emacs po mode...), creating the 
translation:
$ vi YOUR-LANG.po

# You can add your localized screenshots. They go into the YOUR-LANG/figures 
directory.

# When the source files change, updating the po file is easy :
$ xml2po -u YOUR-LANG.po ../C/*xml


Don't forget to send YOUR-LANG.po files to gnomesword-developers@lists.sourceforge.net.
