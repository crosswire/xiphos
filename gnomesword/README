GnomeSword started life as the Sword Project cheatah program and
some of the cheatah code is still used in GnomeSword.

I took the code for setting the scope of a search from
the Bibletime program.

I think I may have taken some code form the Sword Project's windoze
programs also.

I wish to thank the folks who have put so much time and work into the
Sword Project and then giving it to the world! God Bless you!

If you look at my code you will be glad to know that I make my living
as a preacher - not a programmer.

Installing:
############
You need to have the Sword Project (sword-1.5.0) installed.
You need a least one each text ,commentary and dictionary module also.
Sword-1.5.0 and the modules can be found at www.crosswire.org in the Sword Project.

You must also have gnome up and running.
If you are using RedHat you need to have the gnome and gtk dev packages
installed.
It all worked on my RedHat 6.2 system.

First, be sure to read INSTALL in the root of the Sword project
directory for instructions on how to make sure the API
libraries are installed and configured properly.

Then do a:

./configure
make
su
make install
