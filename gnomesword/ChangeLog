	  like me don't try to remove them when helpfully "cleaning up" the 
	  source tree :-)
	* updated spec file with better Requires/BuildRequires

	* comprehensive review of strings: fixed typos, updated, added, 
	  changed around - should be ready for the translators now
	* started to update the preferences dialog. Removed the layout section
	  as this is now done with the session. Removed frames and replaced

	* added spec file based on original by Hugo van der Kooij. This will be 
          generated by configure with the correct information for building based on
          the tarball created by 'make dist'. This is a first draft but it appears to
          work for me.


2003-12-04  Terry <tbiggs@users.sf.net>

	* work on removing GtkFrames and replacing them with GNOME2-style bold 
          headings
	

2003-12-03  Terry <tbiggs@users.sf.net>

	* bumped to 0.9.dev17
	* added gui_alert_dialog() to gnome2/dialog.c - much closer to HIG 
	  for alerts than gui_gs_dialog().
	* added new create_dialog_request() should be easier to get to conform 
	  to the HIG it's called by gui_gs_dialog().
		

2003-12-02  Terry <tbiggs@users.sf.net>

	* work in dialog.c 
	   * rearanged buttons 
	   * stock icon can be added
	   * if title string is not passed to gui_gs_dialog(GS_DIALOG * info)
	     you get no title instead of default title.
	   * top label is formatted bold.
	   * changed code to use gtk_dialog "response" signal when 
	     buttons are clicked instead of button "clicked" signal
	     

2003-12-01  Terry <tbiggs@users.sf.net>

	* fixed bug #852017 (?) - gs will run if setup_druid is canceled
	  but now pops up a dialog and asks if the user wishes to run the 
	  preferences_dialog

	* combined "search results" and "verse list" in the sidebar


2003-11-24  Andy Piper <andyp@users.sf.net>

	* docs are conventionally installed to /usr/share/doc and not to
	  /usr/doc so we'll fix configure.in and Makefile.am to do that. This
	  means that a 'make uninstall' won't kill the /usr/doc directory
	  (which probably only contains a gnomesword2 directory as /usr/doc
	  is not usually present on e.g. RedHat/Fedora systems, probably
          others) so it will need to be removed manually to avoid cruftage.
