TODO:
	* Re-work advanced search (req #1615402):
	  - Attribute search (e.g. Word//Lemma/Gxxx) very confusion-prone.
	  - Search on more than one Strong's ref at a time.
	  - Specify search range on the fly, without having to name it.
	  - Search Hebrew/Greek using native charsets.
	* Improve command use of "sword://" (req #1613239):
	  - Open new tab instead of taking over 1st.
	  - Create gconf key to handle sword://.
	  - Handle bible:// as well, because it's more intuitive anyway.
	  - Create gnomesword-remote (cf. gaim-remote)?
	* Much more needs to be discussed on gnomesword-developers.
